# cppserver
A simple C++ web server using crow

## Description

In this project I wanted to use the C++ language to code a basic web server; I tried out the Crow library and I found that it is awesome, the system is really performant and the utility functions are easy to use 

## Setup

The software runs on a Docker image that includes the g++ compiler and all the other dependencies required.
